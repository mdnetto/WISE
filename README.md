# WISE Workshop

Welcome to the WISE Coding workshop. My name is Michelle, I'm your workshop leader. Feel free to ask me questions!

Today weâ€™re going to explore the Simon game and the main coding concepts that make up the game. 

These three concepts are:
* HTML (adds structure to the layout of the webpage)
* CSS (styles that change the look and feel of the website)
* Javascript (makes our page interactive so we can play Simon!)

### HTML
When writing HTML, you add "tags" to the text in order to create the structure. These tags tell the browser how to display the text or graphics in the document. Tags are surrounded by arrow keys like this. 

```
<html> open html tag
	<head>
		<title> title tag </title>
	</head>
		<body> open body tag
			<div> open div tag
				<div>
					<p> paragraph tag	</p>
					<button> button tag </button> 
					<h1> heading tag </h1>
				</div>
			</div> closing div tag
		</body> closing body tag
</html> closing html tag
```

#### HTML Tag Exercise 1
Everyone will be given an open or closing HTML tag, your job is to find the person who has your matching HTML tag! i.e If you have an open `<p>` tag, look for the person who has the matching closing `</p>` tag. 

#### HTML Tag Exercise 2
HTML tags are often nested inside other tags. For example the `<div>` tag below has a `</p>`, `<button>` and an `<h1>` tag within it.
```
<div>
	<p> paragraph tag	</p>
	<button> button tag </button> 
	<h1> heading tag </h1>
</div>
```

Now that you've found your partner, everyone needs to line up in order that they appear above. Hint: The person with the 

#### HTML Tag Exercise 3
Let's open up the HTML file for Simon and look at the tags.

1. In your editor, look for a file called simon.html
2.
