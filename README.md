# WISE

Welcome to the WISE Coding workshop. My name is Michelle, I'm your workshop leader. Feel free to ask me questions!

Today weâ€™re going to explore the Simon game and the main coding concepts that make up the game. 

These three concepts are:
* HTML (adds structure to the layout of the webpage)
* CSS (styles that change the look and feel of the website)
* Javascript (makes our page interactive so we can play Simon!)
