# WISE Workshop

Welcome to the WISE Coding workshop. My name is Michelle, I'm your workshop leader. Feel free to ask me questions!

Today weâ€™re going to explore the Simon game and the main coding concepts that make up the game. 

These three concepts are:
* HTML (adds structure to the layout of the webpage)
* CSS (styles that change the look and feel of the website)
* Javascript (makes our page interactive so we can play Simon!)

### HTML
When writing HTML, you add "tags" to the text in order to create the structure. These tags tell the browser how to display the text or graphics in the document. Tags are surrounded by arrow keys like this. 

```
<html> opening html tag
	<head>
		<title> title tag </title>
	</head>
		<body> opening body tag
			<div> opening div tag
				<div>
					<p> paragraph tag	</p>
					<button> button tag </button> 
					<h1> heading tag </h1>
				</div>
			</div> closing div tag
		</body> closing body tag
</html> closing html tag
```


Let's open up the HTML file for Simon and look at the tags.

1. In your editor, look for a file called simon.html
2.
